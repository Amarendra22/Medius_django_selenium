# Medius_django_selenium

### I have made an excel data sheet consisting of 5 different enteries, and then used openpyxl library to upload and use my excel data sheet in my python-selenium code to fill the form for all the 5 dataset.

### After the code is run the form filling process starts and the 5 different datasets (different name of people) gets filled in the form and the form gets submitted after that. The screenshots from 1 to 5 are for each of the 5 datasets.
